# Basic_C-Sharp_Projects

This repository contains my C# projects I completed during my software developer bootcamp training with Pitman Training Ireland / The Tech Academy. Some of the most important projects in this repository are:

* [Car Insurance App](https://github.com/Jo1910/Basic_C-Sharp_Projects/tree/master/Car%20Insurance%20App)

This is a database-first MVC application built using the Entity Framework. It takes in user input and calculate a quote based on values provided. It indludes an Admin view for a site administrator. The Admin page shows all quotes issued, along with the user's first name, last name, and email address.
